Used promises to fetch the data and handle any potential errors.
Refactored the code using async/await to simplify the asynchronous flow.
Promises: Using .then and .catch provides clear chaining but can become confusing in more complex cases, leading to "callback hell" when there are many nested .then calls.
Async/Await: Async/await simplifies asynchronous code, making it more readable and synchronous in appearance. The try...catch block makes error handling cleaner.
